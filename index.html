                    <p class="mb-2">
                        Dear School Owner,
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A lot has been said about the pandemic and how it has changed our "normal" as we used to know it. Today, we are all trying to adapt to the new normal that never gave a notice or even bothered to come with a manual ü§¶...but, here's the good news: our superb human nature makes it possible for us to adapt to the strangest of conditions we find ourselves üíØ, hence, our gradual metamorphosis to the "new normal" ‚úåÔ∏è.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A lot of businesses (both private and public) that were hit so hard during the pandemic are gradually getting back on their feet by dancing üï∫ to the tone of the music üé∂. They are simply flowing with the current üåä, instead of struggling with it. For instance, most businesses have tapped into the reality of the online market by focusing more on e-commerce and logistics.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        But, there is one sector that is yet to take full advantage of this "normal', I'm talking about no other than the Educational sector. 
Now, let's go through some of the reasons why this is so:
                    </p>
                    <p class="title is-5">
                        Reason #1: There is nothing like a physical class.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yes, you are very correct! The importance of physical classes can never be overemphasized. In fact, physical classes allows better connection between teachers and pupils/students.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But, what if I told you that there's a better alternative that carries all the features of a physical class... Would you believe me ü§î? Read on.
                    </p>
                    <p class="title is-5">
                        Reason #2: Schools are not adequately prepared.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Again, you are correct. Schools are not prepared to move or adapt to something strange that has never been thought of until recently. At least, there ought to be a long time preparation before schools can be ready.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Well, there's no better time for school owners to up the game of their respective schools than NOW. If businesses can adjust, schools can also do the same.
                    </p>
                    <p class="title is-5">
                        Reason #3: Getting the system is very expensive.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While this is not entirely true, I believe that the cost of an item is dependent on the worth placed on it. 
The running cost of a physical class set-up far outweighs that of an online school system. Markers/Chalk (are we still using this?), electricity, papers, etc are some of the costs that can be saved.
                    </p>
                    <p class="title is-5">
                        Reason #4: Online systems are too complicated to use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Yes, correct again (only from where you are looking at it üòé), but this is where I come in. Most online school management system come with so many ambiguous features that makes it practically impossible to use, especially those with poor user experiences.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ardent WebSolutions has developed a child-friendly system that comes with ONLY what is required to run a school properly ‚≠ê‚ö°, and this works on any device. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, let me talk about the benefits of this system:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <ol class="mx-6">

                    <p>
                        Because we have factored all types of school (big, small, upcoming, whatever name you fall under), and we want ALL schools to benefit from this, we are giving this system out at a one-time giveaway price of <del class="has-text-grey-light has-text-weight-medium">‚Ç¶200,000</del> <strong class="has-text-danger has-text-weight-medium">‚Ç¶150,000</strong>. No subscription or recurring payment for life (apart from your website registration, <em>only for schools without an existing website</em>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Please note that this price will not stay the same as we have a limited number schools we can work with based on this price. We can decide to stop offering the service for this same price without any notice. So, ORDER NOW.
